# lilypad_choose_song_color

Lilypad arduino sketch that:
- uses push button(A5) to light LED(5) and select song:
  - Jingle Bells
  - Let It Go (Frozen)
- uses switch(2) to turn song playing on/off

Arduino card: ProtoSnap - Lilypad Development Board (Arduino)  by SparkFun
Adapter card: FTDI Basic (connect card via USB to Computer for uploads)
Board: "LilyPad Arduino"
Processor: "ATmega328"

Current Progress:
2/9/17
- does not store two songs, or allow to select between them
- appears to be a memory problem (not enough memory for current model)
- currently plays just one song 
- but, I think I can change the Note type and look up tri-color components
- instead of storing them.  For now, back to my real job
